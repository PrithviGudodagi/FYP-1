About The Role
As a Software Developer in the Core Engineering team, your role is to further the development of the Core Platform to meet the needs of our users and the wider business.
You will draw on your skills and experience to both extract and modernise the Core Platform for use by other Technicolor companies, and to maintain ongoing use by MPC. You will focus on developing services and APIs that encapsulate the business logic of the platform, in areas such as compute, storage, digital asset management and digital resource management. You will be building internally facing interfaces to our platform and production data.
The Core Platform has a broad scope and diverse user group. While there is some expectation of the role to work across multiple aspects of the platform (building features, fixing bugs, general enhancements), some developers do specialise and focus on specific subject areas. This may happen immediately, or after some time having gained familiarity with many areas of the platform.
Your Responsibilities
In this role, your responsibilities will include;
Work with your colleagues to develop features, fix bugs, and define new services from start to finish.
Advocate for professional standards of development.
Review events that impact availability and performance to guide future improvements.
Troubleshoot problems across different levels of the stack, and in production environments.
Take responsibility for code quality, always leaving projects in better state than before you started work.
Contribute to maintaining an authoritative source of documentation.
Coordinate with leadership to define and prioritise projects
Support the introduction of new technologies where and when appropriate.
Evangelise use of the Core Platform within MPC and other Technicolor business units.
Take initiative to improve the developer experience in small or large ways.
Mentor and pair with others in the team to encourage the professional and technical growth of others.
Take part in the hiring process by screening applicants, participating in interviews or posing interview questions as required. Own your personal development plan and identify training opportunities for others in the team.
Provide some level of operational support for the platform as required.
Work with the product owner and stakeholders to establish requirements and report progress.


Qualifications

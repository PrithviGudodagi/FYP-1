The Girl s Education Program is currently operating in 7 States across India - Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, New Delhi, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Specifically, the program seeks to achieve increased years of schooling for girls and increase girls self-awareness, decision-making and problem-solving skills.  
The Social Mobilizers are responsible for implementing the Girls Education program at the field level. They are the first point of contact for the girls whom we work with; they are also the point of contact for the schools and parents and hence are critical to the success of the program.
The social mobilizer will report to the Program Associate. The position will be field based: Delhi NCR. She will be responsible for a group of 80 girls as their mentor, support system and motivator.
Duties and Responsibilities: Program planning implementation:
Develop a thorough understanding of Room to Read s Girls Education program design, objectives and outcomes.
Implement program activities as per design maintaining fidelity.
Undertake corrective action and incorporate feedback when provided by the supervisor for life skills sessions etc.
Participate in program planning in consultation with Program Associate and other state level staff.
Regularly attend weekly and monthly workshops where weekly and monthly plans are made and reviewed.
Attend mandatory training of Social Mobilizers.
Family and Community engagement:
Have a thorough understanding of social issues, safety concerns and child protection issues affecting girl participants and an awareness of available social safety net mechanisms, schemes and referrals. (With child protection and safety issues of girls that emerged through a study done in India last year and the new mentoring module that requires the program to address such issues, we need a social mobilizer who is well networked and well acquainted with existing social safety net mechanisms, schemes and also referrals; this skill was not required for our current social mobilizers).
Organize and lead family and community meetings and consultations with school staff, parents and community members/organizations as per design; discuss life skill content and issues with them in a tactful manner (especially sensitive/taboo issues like early marriage and attending school during menstrual cycle).
Seek opportunities for networking at local level and create a resource pool to be used as a referrals if there is a need.
Facilitate visits of donors, INCO and SO team members.
Facilitate and support SO/INCO team members in conducting research/ survey/ study/ data collection/ baseline etc.
Working with girls:
Conduct life skills sessions for 80 girls in batches of 20-25 as per the prescribed session content and as per agreed plan. Each girl will need to be provided with a minimum of 16 life skills sessions in one year. This would require a thorough understanding of the content and skills of delivering it tactfully (especially the content related to reproductive health). The reproductive health sessions that has been introduced in the worldwide GEP modules require more experienced professionals who are well equipped to deliver the content as well as handle queries of parents and convince them on the need for these sessions.
Form Life skills clubs/Children groups and facilitate regular meetings and discussions of these groups; at least 8 meetings are to be held every year. Ensure that through these groups the girl participants develop skills of articulation and self-expression and initiate action on issues they face in their lives. This would require the social mobilizer to have excellent facilitation skills and understanding of the principles of child participation.
Distribute the newsletter GUPSHUP, initiate discussion around it and hold follow-up activities. (This requires an ability to engage with text in a magazine format written for girls - to eventually lead them into an analysis of the magazines/mass media and inspire them to express and deconstruct gender stereotypes).
Help girls to develop wall magazines and write for state-level Gupshup so that their voices can be captured.
Mentoring: Conduct group mentoring sessions for 80 girls in batches of 10-12 girls as per prescribed content guidelines and record each session. Plan out the group mentoring sessions in association with the Program Associate, taking into account the needs expressed by the girls. Conduct individual mentoring sessions as needed. This may need creation of new content wherever needed (The new mentoring module being introduced requires social mobilizers to be barefoot counselors - not just mentoring girls in groups but also identifying challenges being faced by girls, developing sessions to address the challenges, identifying the content for these sessions and developing the content if needed).
Setting up Life skills centers /Gender Resource Centers:
Setting up a Gender resource Center (GRC) for life skills in schools /community for life skills sessions
Ensuring proper functioning and usage of GRC as per discussion with state GEP teams
Ensure the space is clean, safe and welcoming to girls
Ensure the space is well stocked with drawings/articles/ expressions of children s voices ; changing and putting up the articles/drawings/paintings on bulletin board periodically at least once a month
Home visits:
Mapping data as per the risk and response protocol and then making specific home visits. (The objective of the risk and response protocol is to take action based on an analysis of the four risk factors for girls dropping out. This involves tracking of each girl, understanding the risk, flagging concerns, suggesting solutions, motivating the girls to take necessary action and ultimately preventing the girl from dropping out. All this requires a very high level of analytical and strategic thinking skills, which is not currently available in the SMs).
Undertaking regular school visits
Handling any critical matters that may emerge from these interactions
Organizing/conducting programmatic activities at school and community as per mutually agreed plan and responsible for managing relationships with school, community and respond to issues that may arise.
The quality of home visits is expected to be of high as the expectation is of higher levels of engagement and effective mentoring and outreach to families

At Ajira AI, we focus on developing smart products that leverage ai algorithms. We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.

We re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we re now looking to add two experienced Mobile App Developers to our team in Pune.

You have extensive experience with native mobile app development and have worked on the design, development, launch and support of at least two mobile apps. You ve worked with Android or iOS using Java or Objective C / SWIFT and graduated onto Xamarin. You ve developed excellent skills in Javascript including ReactNative/React. You understand the need and how to wipe your app and data off the device if needed.

That s a high level summary of what we re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

We are an early stage start-up with a core mission of leveraging ai algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and play with the latest advances in tools and technology.

We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, we have remote developers as well. We have decades of experience working with remote team members. We re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a no insane hours rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on a fancy office space.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.

Your skills:

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs

You have worked previously with Java or Objective C /SWIFT on Android or iOS

You ve used Realm-Redux and dealt with SHA1 encryption on the device.

You have designed, developed, launched and supported at least two mobile apps

If you re not available or interested in this position but know someone who might be a good fit, please pass this along

#Never Give Up #Always Rise And Shine

THIYAGU Senior DevOps Engineer About three years ago I joined T2S's DevOps team, and I am proud to say that it has been a wonderful journey so far. We are all like a big family who share the same goal and commitment towards their work. And I am lucky to have found some like- minded people here. This company's ""One for all, all for one"" belief is what sets them apart from other companies.

ARUL MATHEWS UX Architect Working at Touch2Success has been a great experience for me. It's a company with a big vision. I find the company's journey quite inspiring - how everything started and how much evolved they are now and, still continue to do so. My role in T2S gives me a lot of opportunities to try new things every now and then, but the best part is the culture here. Employees get rewarded for their hard work on a monthly, and quarterly basis. The overall vibe of this place is quite fun, and I really love it here. According to me, Touch2Success really values each of their employees and are not hesitant to gratify them, every once in a while.

MOHAMED MATTAN CS Senior Team Leader From the moment I started working at T2S, it has always felt like home. The constant support, the consistent energy, and the fun atmosphere prove the foundations of this company are very much employee- centric. Yes! And it doesnt stop there. The flexible work culture and a strong belief in empowering teams and leadership are what fuses us to keep going and achieve new heights of success within the company. Im glad to be part of this journey and proud to be part of the T2S family. #T2SforLife #HustleHard #Wakanda

MOHAMED IMRAN A Trainee Team Lead I have been working with T2S for 2+ years and its been an amazing journey right from the start - the day of my interview. Its a friendly atmosphere where you could open up with your views and suggestions without fears. Over the past 2 years, I have seen some unique rapid growth. And guess what Its still growing astonishingly. Overall, a very friendly Management and a good environment to work with.

#Self Belief and Honest Will Always Earn You Success

Shefana Asmi K Senior Analyst Its a great environment to work at. I would confidently say that T2S is the best company I have worked for, in my entire career spanning to almost 4 years. I am happy that I work here. Great team, helpful colleagues and full- fledged fun activities always make me feel this as a home away from my home.

Ardit Mula Team Lead When I started working at Touch2Success, I only had basic knowledge of technology, since then I have been given amazing opportunities to learn and have come a very long way, I can comfortably say that most of the things I have learned are due to T2S. One of the best things about working here is the freedom given and the long term investment which I havent seen at any other company. I have really enjoyed the past 5 years working in the company and hope to continue many more years.

BIJU ABRAHAM Senior Business Analyst Above all the positives, the one thing I appreciate the most about the company is that it has given me the opportunity to work in a multicultural environment with amazing colleagues. T2S premier league, Badminton tournament; entertainments just do not stop at Touch2Success. Awesome work culture leading to heights of flexibility.

GODWIN JUSTIN PHILIPSZ Senior Business Analyst

Touch2Success is growing, but Intelligently.

Ive been with Touch2Success for over a year now and I truly enjoy coming to work in such a friendly atmosphere. I can easily keep on bragging about the Culture we have here. The positive atmosphere at Touch2Success is noticeable at all levels. People always smile, they are helpful and upbeat. Other companies just talk the talk, but the body language here says something entirely different and truthful. You could feel a stream of energy from the top down that is contagious and a synergy that crosses the company laterally.

My choice was based on two things. The people and the work.

JOSHI ABRAHAM C Senior Business Analyst It's been 2 years with T2S now. Such a Great Company to work for. It was a startup company when I stepped in, but I will say that no more. Touch2Success has had a huge growth in terms of employees, clients and even the office space in the last couple of years. This is the right place for those who have talent and are eager to work. I have never seen a CEO like ours who is down to earth and so motivating. His vision is vast, yet so realistic. Im PROUD to be a part of this wonderful journey.

When we started up in London many moons ago in 2010, we had vague ideas about doing smart-data related work in energy markets. We envisioned a team of super bright and inspired professionals from several nationalities combining their skills to change the world - making energy greener, cheaper, and abundant, to enhance the future of humanity.

We realised early on that our mission of 300 GW on AI-interworking was unlikely to be fulfilled through traditional methods from the 20th century - no disruptive startup scales-up using old methods. We needed to take a risk and bet on future technology. This bet was on clever analytical software - analytical because its driven by data; ‘clever’ because it can think for itself, driven by Machine Learning and more broadly Artificial Intelligence.

We Urgently Looking for Software Engineer for one Reputed Software developer Company Loacted at Pune Location Role -Lead Software Engineer
When we started up in London many moons ago in 2010, we had vague ideas about doing smart-data related work in energy markets. We envisioned a team of super bright and inspired professionals from several nationalities combining their skills to change the world - making energy greener, cheaper, and abundant, to enhance the future of humanity.

We realised early on that our mission of 300 GW on AI-interworking was unlikely to be fulfilled through traditional methods from the 20th century - no disruptive startup scales-up using old methods. We needed to take a risk and bet on future technology. This bet was on clever analytical software - analytical because its driven by data; ‘clever’ because it can think for itself, driven by Machine Learning and more broadly Artificial Intelligence.

Recruiting Software and Applicant Tracking System Recruiterbox. com Recruitment software to track job applicants Recruiterbox is a recruitment software that simplifies and optimizes your hiring process. Post job openings, manage candidates, collaborate with colleagues and use data to help you make an informed decision all in one place.
1500+ fast-growing companies use the Recruiterbox Applicant Tracking System The challenge: Hire a bunch of great people for our new store. We needed a way to keep track and organize thousands of applications across numerous departments coming in from different sources.
The solution: Recruiterbox!
In a span of one year, we grew from a sales team of 250 people to over 800 in India alone. Recruiterbox has enabled us to manage nearly 500 interviews per week and execute our hiring efficiently across geographies.

Why you will love using recruiterbox
Create jobs once. Update everywhere Create an opening and reflect it on your company website or on a careers-page hosted by us. Broadcast jobs to search engines and share them on your social media accounts.

Create a (customizable) set of steps according to your recruitment process and track candidates as they flow through the stages of your hiring funnel.
Assign responsibilities to your team Invite your colleagues to work on recruitment. Have people responsible for candidates in specific stages, forward candidates and collect shared feedback.
Create a completely customizable application form to collect richer information from applicants beyond the resume.
One stop for candidates from all sources Collect all job applicants at one place, whether they come via email, job-boards, your careers page or even folders.
All recruitment information in one place Discuss candidates, share evaluations, attach documents / notes to candidates in one place. No more information buried under a pile of email.
See what makes Recruiterbox better than most recruitment software
Truly web-based applicant tracking Unlike most applicant tracking systems, Recruiterbox is completely web-based. There is nothing to download, install, update or maintain.

The most intuitive recruitment software Disillusioned with software that is cumbersome to use. Recruiterbox is built to get out of your way and get the job done.

Recruiterbox pricing is all-inclusive. There are no hidden charges, installation costs, long term contracts or binding commitments.
Do you use email spreadsheets to manage your hiring today Here is why you should consider recruiterbox.

More efficient than email spreadsheets If you receive job applications in your email, you know how tedious it is to download open each attached resume. Also, searching through attachments is impossible. Spreadsheets can help you structure data, but are also not ideal for resume tracking.
With Recruiterbox, all applicant information is gathered and made searchable in one place.


One-stop Resume Management Often, candidate information is spread across files, emails, notepads and memory. Recruiterbox helps you to gather the resumes from multiple sources and manage them from a single place. Now you can source, track and hire candidates with ease.


Automated Applicant Tracking Most of the time in hiring is spent in emailing candidates, assigning people to interview them, or simply screening applicants from a pile.
Recruiterbox helps you minimize the time spent on administrative tasks. Spend less time ""managing"" hiring and more time actually hiring.





Customizable recruitment process Each company and its hiring methodology is unique. Recruiterbox helps map your recruitment workflow in to completely customizable stages. You can easily create / edit these stages and assign them to people in your organization.


Hire as a team Recruiting involves discussion sharing candidate evaluations, scheduling interviews and delegating tasks - in short, team work.
Recruiterbox lets you easily organize and share all reviews and communication around a candidate. It also keeps track and notifies you of important events and tasks.



New to Recruitment Software Here's what you need to know What is a Recruitment Software anyway Recruitment Software - also often called as applicant tracking system (ATS) - is a tool that enables companies to electronically handle their recruitment needs. Recruitment softwares are used by both large enterprises and smaller companies, but vary in functionality and features depending on the needs of the company. A Recruitment software is very similar to customer relationship management (CRM) systems, but is designed specifically for recruitment tracking purposes.

What does a Recruitment Software do The primary job of a recruitment software is centralizing all the information about a company's recruitment efforts in a database. Applicant Tracking Systems are designed to add structure to the processing of resumes and applicant information. Applicant data is either collected from internal applications (through the front-end), located on the company website or is extracted from applicants on job boards. Some modern ATSs allow applicants to be sourced from the company's own database of past job applicants.


What are the types of Recruitment Software Almost all companies use some kind of applicant tracking system or recruitment software to handle job applications and to manage resume data. Some smaller firms use email and/ or spreadsheets to manage this, but most companies use a dedicated ATS for recruitment specific needs. In large enterprises, recruitment software may be offered as one of the numerous modules of a complex human resources suite or Human Resource Information System (HRIS).
The older recruitment softwares are typically installed within the company premises and have a one-time installation cost. In recent years, the ATS is expanding into small and medium enterprises through software as a service offerings (SaaS). With SaaS, companies can now pay for recruitment software on a pay-as-you-go basis. This has been instrumental in increasing the penetration of ATS in smaller companies.

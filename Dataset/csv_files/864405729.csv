Inbound Marketing Specialist

Is Inbound Marketing your calling? Do you know the ins and outs of Hubspot? Hop on board and help us take the Searce brand to the next level!

Job Title: Inbound Marketing Specialist

What are we looking for?

Natural creativity: The best marketers are creative visionaries, people who are capable of stepping back, seeing the big picture, and coming up with new ways of approaching challenges and making positive changes to how the company is managed and marketed.
Not a CAVEr: You are a person that people like to be around. You are not a CAVE (Constantly Against Virtually Everything) personality.
Say no to HiPPO: At Searce, we want people who value everyones opinions & perspectives. We dont want them to get overpowered by HiPPO (Highest Paid Persons Opinion).
T-shaped skill set: To take it further, in an ideal world, we are not just looking for someone with experience managing projects and people. We are also looking for a T-shaped marketer someone with a diverse skill set that spans all disciplines relevant to “Searce”, alongside a deep knowledge of one key area.

Job Responsibilities

Be our in-house Hubspot pro! Leveraging Hubspot to drive demand generation for Cloud, AI, ML and other products & services which are part of Searce’s offerings.
Help us grow! Get new leads by converting site traffic through calls-to-action, landing pages, and lead generation content (including whitepapers, case studies, e-books, reports,etc.) while collaborating with the Content Team.
Leverage content assets which result in asset downloads in exchange for contact information, thereby helping lead generation.
Generate leads galore! Continually look for new ways to generate leads and manage targeted list development.
Create, run and optimise marketing automation via Hubspot and lead nurturing processes through email, content, and social channels.
Continually track, monitor and optimise On and Off page SEO opportunities.
Management of Paid Advertising budgets through Adwords and Social Advertising channels.
Establish closed-loop analytics with sales to understand how our inbound marketing activity turns into customers, and continually refine our process to convert customers.

Qualification

Is Education overrated? Yes. We believe so. But there is no way to locate you otherwise. So we might look for at least a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing and prefer an MBA or Masters in Marketing.
Or else, did you leverage marketing to help your friend’s business scale up while in High School. For us, the latter is better as it shows you have a marketing mindset. We will find you faster if you specify the latter in some manner. :)
5-8 years of successful experience defining, leading and executing Inbound Marketing Strategies in B2B or SaaS organizations.
Team Lead experience of 2+ years would be preferred
Excellent communicator and creative thinker, with an ability to use data to inform all decisions
Proficiency in Marketing Automation (specially Hubspot) in order to generate traffic, convert visitors into leads, and then nurture them (using dynamic workflows) into converted customers.
Entrepreneurial and a self-starter, just as comfortable setting strategy as executing the details.
Experienced in advising product teams about potential markets, desirable product features, go-to-market best practices, and measuring the success of outreach and product sales.
Hands-on experience working with Hubspot is a must.
Hubspot Inbound Marketing Certification & Adwords Certification will be highly preferred.

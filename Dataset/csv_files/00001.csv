• Good design and good usability are not buzz words for us. It s our raison d tre. Our apps are second nature to our customers. And we don t want it any other way. As we scale our business and add more products to our roadmap, we need UI/ UX Designers who share our passion for simplicity. We re looking for designers:

• Who can get into the skin of the user and come up with simple wireframes to solve a problem.
• Who are experienced with modern tools for wireframing (Balsamiq, Moqups, Inkspace, etc.) and tools for high- fidelity mockups (Illustrator, Photoshop etc.)
• With excellent communication skills, who believe that copywriting is an integral part of the design process. (Have you ever obsessed on what a form field should be labelled How best to describe WHAT to enter in a form field)
• If the thought of solving hard problems excites you; if having your fingerprints all over our core products gets you going; and if you d like to do this working with a super- charged team in Goa; connect with us. We re eager to hear from you.

What would a typical week, in the shoes of a UX Designer, look like:

• Discus a spec with the Product Manager. Understand the problem being solved. Question why a certain approach is being taken. Bring a fresh perspective to the table. Convince, or get convinced.
• Wireframe possible options/ directions to solve the problem at hand. Clearly articulate why a particular direction works, or why it doesn t. Brainstorm with the Product Manager. Again, convince, or get convinced.
• Pick a design direction, and now, obsess over the details form labels, help text, tooltips, blank states, first- user walkthroughs. The whole works.
• Finally, deliver high fidelity designs.
• Who do we think would be a good fit for this role:

• Someone with an analytical bent of mind
• Someone adept with at least one wireframing tool, like Balsamiq, Axure, Moqups, etc.
• Someone adept with at least one high- fidelity tool, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Inkscape, etc.
• Someone with excellent communication skills. We believe copywriting is part of the design process, especially for this role.
• Someone who has working knowledge of HTML & CSS. If you can actually get your hands dirty and write HTML & CSS, then it s even better

Responsibilities:

- Participate in the product life cycle to understand directly from the Product Team the expected behavior of the apps and the use cases being implemented.

- Participate in design discussions with heavy focus on modeling entities and interactions, following architectural patterns like MVP, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.

- Collaborate with cross-functional teams - backend teams for finalizing APIs, design team for UI / UX, QA team for testing, etc.

- Participate in iteration planning to give effort estimates.

- Write clean, readable, maintainable and performant code following well established design principles.

- Write Unit Tests and Integration Tests to ensure correctness.

- Track, debug and fix bugs & crashes escalated.

- Ensure the apps are performant - no memory leaks, no frame drops, battery usage, etc.

- Explore and evaluate new technologies, tools and SDKs as may be necessary to improve the entire development pipeline.

- Work with cross-platform technologies, like Kotlin Multiplatform, to ensure consistency of features and code reuse across Android / iOS platforms.

Products & Systems Overview:

You will be contributing to products concerning both customers and partner drivers.

Customer App :

- All orders serviced by Porter are placed from this app making it our primary business driver.

- To keep the code for this large complex app maintainable, there is a heavy emphasis on good design and architecture. Currently the RIBs framework is used to break the code recursively into smaller components.

- To ensure feature parity and consistency across our Android and iOS platforms, we use Kotlin Multiplatform to re-use business logic code across the two platforms.

Partner App :

- All orders serviced by Porter are fulfilled by drivers using this app.

- Given that the app is expected to run for long hours on cheaper phones there is a heavy emphasis on keeping the apps performant - optimizing battery consumption and memory usage.

- The app serves as a medium for onboarding - providing functionality for partners to upload and verify their documents using Image Processing.

- To train the drivers for every new feature launched, we provide a guided audio-visual training session - using visual cues like hint to click / swipe with synchronized pre-configured audio to guide him through the sequence of steps.

Fleet Owner Apps :

- A multi-platform app for fleet owners to manage their drivers and track their performance and earnings on our platform.

UNDP Jobs - 78339 - Individual Consultant - Project Coordinator Creating Employment and Entrepreneurship Opportunities for Women in India (Disha) is a multi - year partnership project between United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and India Development Foundation (IDF) , supported by IKEA Foundation. Project Disha aims to reach out and enable one million underprivileged women in India through training, employment and entrepreneurship skills development, as well as development of a new model of public private collaboration that can be adapted and replicated across India. The project activities are implemented across four states of India viz. NCR Delhi & Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana. The project works in close partnership with GOI Ministries and departments, public and private organizations especially skilling institutes, employers and livelihood organizations to facilitate job placement and entrepreneurship activities among young women.

Since the start of the Proof of the Concept phase in October 2015, more than 100 pilots have been designed and more than twenty pilots completed and fifty pilots are in various stages of completion. The lessons from these pilots, evaluated during the mid - term review and the strategic review in , led to the creation of four concrete models that cuts across the three verticals (bridging the information gap, skills to job and entrepreneurship) . They are briefly summarized below:

Model 1: Creation of career guidance and counselling framework in government schools and colleges to enable girls from the under - privileged sections make and pursue informed and inspired career choices.

Model 2: Creation of employment bazaar or marketplace in unserved smaller towns and semi - urban areas which according to a recent McKinsey report have scope for large traction in terms of employment and / or apprenticeship sourcing.

Model 3: Micro - enterprise in rural areas and self - employment in urban areas responding to the preference of women with domestic responsibilities for local sources of livelihood as well as the opportunities arising of changing lifestyle, especially in urban areas.

Model 4: Enterprise opportunities through value chain linkages with the organized sector in areas such as agri - produce, handlooms and garments, and artisanal products. These areas are the mainstay of livelihood for women in the non - formal sector. Over the past two years the project has evolved substantially and it now requires focusing on delivering in accordance with the models developed. There is a clear mandate on institutionalizing these models into the government and / or the corporate sector while leveraging resources to ensure sustainability.

Considering that the scope of the project is manifold and extends beyond traditional partners / sectors, project Disha seeks to engage a senior Consultant to provide guidance to the State team in designing of innovative pilots / activities and implementation of pilots.

Duties and Responsibilities

Under the direct supervision of the Chief, Skills and Business Development, UNDP and in coordination with the Senior Programme Advisor and Project Analyst, the Coordinator will perform the following responsibilities -

Provide overall coordination to the Project Management Unit for the implementation of the project in the implementing states to achieve project goals;

Provide technical support to the state teams placed in the NCR Delhi and Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana to design pilots, in accordance to the four models and the Theory of Change (TOC) ;

Coordinate with other Disha project partners like India Development Foundation (IDF) to ensure that the proposed pilot (s) are robust and approved as per the Theory of Change (TOC) of the project;

At Ajira AI, we focus on developing smart products that leverage ai algorithms. We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.

We re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we re now looking to add two (2) experienced Developers to our team in Pune.

You have extensive experience with front end development using frameworks such as Aurelia/AngularJS/Vue/React. If you have some hands-on experience with UI Frameworks such as Semantic UI that is great. Any experience with C#.NET and NodeJS is welcome. You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what s happening in the front-end world and know the differences between ES5, ES6 and ECMAScript 2018. You know the limitations of TypeScript. You are motivated to learn new technologies.

That s a high level summary of what we re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

We are an early stage start-up with a core mission of leveraging ai algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and play with the latest advances in tools and technology.

We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, we have remote developers as well. We have decades of experience working with remote team members. We re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a no insane hours rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on a fancy office space.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.

Your skills:

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs

You are skilled with ES5 & ES6, TypeScript and a minimum of one of Aurelia/AnjularJS/React/Vue

If you are experienced in C#.NET that s preferred as is any hand-on with NodeJS and Semantic UI

Any SQL database experience is a plus as is any background in math

You have developed, implemented and supported a complex business application

If you re not available or interested in this position but know someone who might be a good fit, please pass this along

NCMC is an inter - operable transport card conceived by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs of the Government of India. PayCraft is a pioneer and a leading solution provider for the NCMC technology in India. The solution enables banks to issue NCMC debit or prepaid cards which can be used in transit as a contactless payment method and in retail or online platforms just like any other banking card.

Contact or contactless transactions
AI based fraud engine

NCMC on Debit Cards
Banks can now upgrade their regular debit card management system to NCMC capable debit card management system. Government of India s vision for One Nation One Card (ONOC) envisages that every debit card in India shall have capability to handle contactless transit transaction. This would mean that debit cards shall be issued with contactless chip supporting Rupay qSparc specifications. PayCraft offers the NCMC DCMS plugin which helps banks to start issuing qSparc enabled debit cards and manage transit transaction without making much change to the existing debit card management system of a bank.

This Team must be able to report out on our Benefits offerings and elections globally effectively ‘connecting the systems together’ (plus connecting in with the Benchmarking Team / Benefits Strategy Team to potentially also wrap in the Mercer GOLD system / data).
Provide Benefits information as an input into the annual refresh of the Total Employment Costs (TEC) multipliers. In year 1 the Team will need to determine the best format for the data to be provided (connecting in with the Service Centers) and ongoing these requirements will need to be validated annually.
Running reports to support M&A activity. Having the ability to pull data from Workday and the various Platforms (plus Tier 0 documents) will allow us to quickly support data requests pertaining to M&A / business restructuring activity. The Global Benefits Systems Manager will scope out the requirements with the various above country Teams e.g. the Reward CoE Teams, Regional Service Centres and work with these Specialist roles to ensure that those deliverables can be met.
4. General Benefits Systems Support / Expertise

Job description:-

Expected Qualities

Detail Oriented: Attention to detail is critical when you're overseeing so many different aspects of the project, all of which are important to its well-being and success.
Dependable: The project manager is going to depend on the project coordinator to handle the minutiae of the project's management, and therefore, it's crucial that the project coordinator is dependable and can be relied on to uphold their responsibilities without having to be micromanaged.
Good Communicator: Think of the project coordinator as the bridge connecting the project manager to various other project members, then you can see the importance of having superior communications skills. They need to understand the message and deliver it clearly to the target audience.
Productive: The project demands productivity from its participants, and this is especially true for the project coordinator. Coordinators are often the grease that keeps the wheels of the project turning, so it's doubly important that they're productive.
Get Things Done: The last thing a project manager wants is a project coordinator who is given a task and then doesn't follow-through. The project coordinator has a great deal of autonomy, but if they can't get things done, then its all for naught. The ability to get things done is probably the biggest requirement on a project coordinator job description.

Roles and Responsibilities:
Coordinate project management activities, resources, equipment and information
 Break projects into doable actions and set time frames
Coordinate with Site to identify and define requirements, scope and objectives
Assign tasks to internal teams and assist with schedule management
Make sure that Site needs are met as projects evolve
Help prepare budgets
Analyze risks and opportunities
Oversee project procurement management
 Monitor project progress and handle any issues that arise
 Act as the point of contact and communicate project status to all participants
Use tools to monitor working hours, plans and expenditures
Creating a project schedule, with milestones, due dates and estimates for those materials that are required.
 Helping with the documentation of each phase of the project, as well as making summary reports that will be presented to the organization's management team.

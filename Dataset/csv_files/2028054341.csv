UNDP Jobs - 78339 - Individual Consultant - Project Coordinator Creating Employment and Entrepreneurship Opportunities for Women in India (Disha) is a multi - year partnership project between United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and India Development Foundation (IDF) , supported by IKEA Foundation. Project Disha aims to reach out and enable one million underprivileged women in India through training, employment and entrepreneurship skills development, as well as development of a new model of public private collaboration that can be adapted and replicated across India. The project activities are implemented across four states of India viz. NCR Delhi & Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana. The project works in close partnership with GOI Ministries and departments, public and private organizations especially skilling institutes, employers and livelihood organizations to facilitate job placement and entrepreneurship activities among young women.

Since the start of the Proof of the Concept phase in October 2015, more than 100 pilots have been designed and more than twenty pilots completed and fifty pilots are in various stages of completion. The lessons from these pilots, evaluated during the mid - term review and the strategic review in , led to the creation of four concrete models that cuts across the three verticals (bridging the information gap, skills to job and entrepreneurship) . They are briefly summarized below:

Model 1: Creation of career guidance and counselling framework in government schools and colleges to enable girls from the under - privileged sections make and pursue informed and inspired career choices.

Model 2: Creation of employment bazaar or marketplace in unserved smaller towns and semi - urban areas which according to a recent McKinsey report have scope for large traction in terms of employment and / or apprenticeship sourcing.

Model 3: Micro - enterprise in rural areas and self - employment in urban areas responding to the preference of women with domestic responsibilities for local sources of livelihood as well as the opportunities arising of changing lifestyle, especially in urban areas.

Model 4: Enterprise opportunities through value chain linkages with the organized sector in areas such as agri - produce, handlooms and garments, and artisanal products. These areas are the mainstay of livelihood for women in the non - formal sector. Over the past two years the project has evolved substantially and it now requires focusing on delivering in accordance with the models developed. There is a clear mandate on institutionalizing these models into the government and / or the corporate sector while leveraging resources to ensure sustainability.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

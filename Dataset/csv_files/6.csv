At Ajira AI, we focus on developing smart products that leverage ai algorithms. We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.

We re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we re now looking to add two (2) experienced Developers to our team in Pune.

You have extensive experience with front end development using frameworks such as Aurelia/AngularJS/Vue/React. If you have some hands-on experience with UI Frameworks such as Semantic UI that is great. Any experience with C#.NET and NodeJS is welcome. You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what s happening in the front-end world and know the differences between ES5, ES6 and ECMAScript 2018. You know the limitations of TypeScript. You are motivated to learn new technologies.

That s a high level summary of what we re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

We are an early stage start-up with a core mission of leveraging ai algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and play with the latest advances in tools and technology.

We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, we have remote developers as well. We have decades of experience working with remote team members. We re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a no insane hours rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on a fancy office space.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.

Your skills:

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs

You are skilled with ES5 & ES6, TypeScript and a minimum of one of Aurelia/AnjularJS/React/Vue

If you are experienced in C#.NET that s preferred as is any hand-on with NodeJS and Semantic UI

Any SQL database experience is a plus as is any background in math

You have developed, implemented and supported a complex business application

If you re not available or interested in this position but know someone who might be a good fit, please pass this along

A natural ability to think outside of the box, putting years of SAS experience to good use so the root cause is resolved rather than the surface issue presented to the team.
An understanding of SAS Metadata.
Visual Analytics experience is a bonus although most of our queries are based technically around ETL failures or issues with communicating with external platforms.
The ability to handle multiple queries of varying degrees of complexity is essential for this role.

Job Description

A moderate degree of experience with ETLs, understand the sourcing, staging, and loading of data, and some knowledge of the various technologies where data is obtained from (Teradata, Cloudera Hadoop, Mainframe).
A good understanding of the end-to-end process of creating, deploying, scheduling and ultimately assessing whether a job has failed or finished to completion. This will require a moderate degree of experience with DI Studio, Management Console and Platform Process Manager (LSF). Anyone with Batch Support experience would be acceptable.
Intermediate to advanced knowledge of SAS code, preferably SAS macro as well. Many of our users require assistance with occasionally trivial but usually complex code issues that need to be explained in non-complex language
A natural ability to think outside of the box, putting years of SAS experience to good use so the root cause is resolved rather than the surface issue presented to the team.
An understanding of SAS Metadata.
Visual Analytics experience is a bonus although most of our queries are based technically around ETL failures or issues with communicating with external platforms.
The ability to handle multiple queries of varying degrees of complexity is essential for this role.

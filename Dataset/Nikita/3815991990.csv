Integrity
 We are hold ourselves to a higher moral standard. We treat our employees like family. We don’t tolerate lying, cheating or stealing to get ahead or for selfish interests. We speak to others with respect, regardless of their status or position. We stand up to bullies and protect the “little guy” if we can. We do not gossip but instead are open and honest with our feedback to each other, our clients and our suppliers, to help each other grow. 4
Learning and Innovation
 We are always looking for new ideas to improve ourselves, our products or our industry. We love seeking out new efficiencies and are always looking for faster, cooler and better ways of operation. We open to try new things and make mistakes because we know this helps us learn, grow and develop. We place immense value on training, education, and we prioritize time spent to educating ourselves, and then applying that knowledge. 4
Perfect in Preparation, Flexible in Reality Failure to prepare is absolutely preparing to fail. Whether for a presentation, a support ticket, a new feature development, every role requires effort and planning if you want the best result, there is no exception to this. However, we are also realistic and know that you can’t be rigid in today’s world where things rarely go to plan! That’s why we stay calm, breathe deep and adapt when s*** hits the fan. 4
Accountable and Proactive Problem Solver We take responsibility for our mistakes, or those of others on our team. Rather than blame others or look for excuses, we instead “own” the problem and solve it by taking massive, decisive action to the best we can, rather than sitting idle waiting for help. 3
Enjoy the Journey
 We believe having fun and being serious about our work are not mutually exclusive. Success is most rewarding when it’s in a positive environment, supported by great friends. We believe in practicing positive enthusiasm wherever possible. Attitude is everything. 3
Dominate, as a Team
 Make no mistake, Entire are ultra-competitive and play not just to win, but to dominate. However, we believe the best achievements come when as a team, we set a goal, strive and achieve it. This is regardless if you’re a client, employee or partner, we believe in sharing the rewards when those goals are achieved.
